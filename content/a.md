I come with a mixed bag of experience - academic research and teaching, analytical roles in finance and insurance, and leadership roles at established multinational companies and hypergrowth startups. The common denominator is a desire to create lasting impact through data and analytics, and an ability to build data teams with a high-performance culture.

I live in Dublin, Ireland and enjoy parkrun on a Saturday morning, coaching my sons' GAA and rugby teams and learning new recipes.
